Particle in a 1D Box — Quantum Mechanics Simulation

Author: Md. Mahiuddin Zilani
Language: Python
Topic: Quantum mechanics / Computational physics

Overview:
This project simulates a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well (particle in a box).
It calculates wavefunctions (psi_n(x)) and probability densities (|psi_n(x)|^2) for different quantum numbers n.
The results are plotted in two separate graphs for clear visualization.

Theory:
For an infinite square well of length L with rigid walls at x=0 and x=L:
psi_n(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(n * pi * x / L), where n = 1,2,3...
E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)​
