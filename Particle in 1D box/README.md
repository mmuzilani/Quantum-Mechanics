Overview

This repository contains a small Python script that simulates a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well (particle in a box).
It computes analytical stationary wavefunctions 
ψn(x)

(x), probability densities

, and displays them in separate subplots for clear visualization.

Theory

For an infinite square well of length 
L
L with rigid walls at 
x=0
x=0 and 
x=L
x=L, the normalized eigenfunctions and energies are:

ψn(x)=2L sin⁡ ⁣(nπxL),n=1,2,3,…
ψ
